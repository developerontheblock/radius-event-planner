# Radius Event Planner (WIP)

### Overview

This application is designed to identify and invite partners located within a 100km radius of our office to the company's event celebration. It filters a comprehensive list of partners based on their geographical proximity(lat, long) to our office and organizes the eligible partners by their ID in ascending order. The output includes both the names and IDs of the partners who meet the criteria for an invitation.
